Subject: [PATCH] manifest.c: Always initialize preserver pointer of file list

In case a bundle has nothing in common with any other installed
bundle (no files duplicated in different bundles) the preserver
pointer inside deduplicate_files_from_manifest() isn't
initialized which leads to NULL as output of the function.
As result no files of the deleted bundle get deleted at all.

Upstream-Status: Backport [v3.0.0+]
