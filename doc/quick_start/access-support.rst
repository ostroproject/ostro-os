Ostro |trade| Project Access and Community Support Resources
############################################################

Here’s a quick summary of resources to find Ostro OS images, source code,
documentation, and support systems:

* Ostro Project Website
   The website https://ostroproject.org is the central source of  
   information about the Ostro Project.  On this site you'll find current information
   about the project as well as all the relevent links to project material 
   (including this documentation).

* Image Releases
   Pre-built Ostro OS images for all the :ref:`platforms` are available at
   https://download.ostroproject.org

   In there you’ll find folders for each of
   the supported hardware platforms. In the platform folder, you’ll find an
   :file:`.dsk` file that can be written directly onto a hard disk or
   USB thumb drive and booted.  There’s also a :file:`.vdi` file for use with VirtualBox.

* Software Updates
   The Ostro OS uses a rolling updates development and release process using "bundle"  
   technology developed by the Clear Linux\* OS for Intel |reg| Architecture team.  You 
   can read more about bundles at `Clear Linux Project Software Update`_ and about Ostro OS
   specifics from :ref:`software-update`

.. _`Clear Linux Project Software Update`: https://clearlinux.org/features/software-update
   
* Source Code on GitHub
   Ostro OS source code is maintained on a public GitHub repository at
   https://github.com/ostroproject. Check out the README there for more information
   about the repository and its organization.

* Documentation
   Project techical documentation is under development along with the Ostro OS itself, and
   can be found at https://ostroproject.org/documentation. 
   Document sources are
   stored within the meta-ostro GitHub repo for the Ostro Project.  The document sources are processed 
   to generate the website documentation your currently reading but can also
   be processed to generate a local website that can be read offline.

* Issue Reporting and Tracking
   Requirements and Issue tracking is done for now using GitHub issues here:
   https://github.com/ostroproject/ostro-os/issues  You can browse through the reported issues
   and submit issues of your own.
  

* Mailing List
   Mailing lists are a convenient way to communicate with Ostro project members as
   well as other developers interested in the Ostro OS.  These lists are perhaps
   the most convenient way to track developer discussions and to ask your own
   support questions to the Ostro OS community.  Available mailing lists and how to subscribe
   information is on https://lists.ostroproject.org.
   You can also read through
   the mailing list archives to follow past posts and discussions.

* IRC Chatting
   You can chat online with the Ostro OS developer community and other users in
   our IRC channel ``#ostroproject`` on the freenode.net IRC server.  You can use
   the http://webchat.freenode.net web client 
   or use a client-side application
   such as :command:`pidgin`.  Communication on IRC is immediate but transient,
   making it good for meetings or a quick discussion.  (IRC discussions are
   not recorded so it's better to use the mailing list for open discussions
   with the community of developers.)
