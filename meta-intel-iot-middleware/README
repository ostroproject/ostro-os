meta-intel-iot-middleware
=========================

This is the middleware layer for the Intel IoT developer kit. Here are
middleware parts useful for the iot-devkit but not shipped as part of meta-oe
or backports from newer versions of meta-oe which are not appropriate for
meta-oe itself. Software in here is likely to follow a more agressive upgrade
schedule.

This layer depends on:

Guidelines for submitting patches
=================================

Please submit pull requests on the github mirror here: 
https://github.com/ostroproject/meta-intel-iot-middleware

Patches should at minimum follow the suggestions outlined in the 'How to 
Submit a Change' secion in the Yocto Project Development Manual.  
Specifically, they should:

  - Include a 'Signed-off-by:' line.  A commit can't legally be pulled
    in without this.

  - Provide a single-line, short summary of the change.  This short
    description should be prefixed by the BSP or recipe name, as
    appropriate, followed by a colon.  Capitalize the first character
    of the summary (following the colon).

  - For the body of the commit message, provide detailed information
    that describes what you changed, why you made the change, and the
    approach you used.

  - If the change addresses a specific bug or issue that is associated
    with a bug-tracking ID, include a reference to that ID in your
    detailed description in the following format: [YOCTO #<bug-id>].

  - Pay attention to line length - please don't allow any particular
    line in the commit message to stretch past 72 characters.

  - For any non-trivial patch, provide information about how you
    tested the patch, and for any non-trivial or non-obvious testing
    setup, provide details of that setup.

Doing a quick 'git log' will provide you with many
examples of good example commits if you have questions about any
aspect of the preferred format.

The maintainers will do their best to review and/or pull in a patch or patchset
within 48 hours of the time it was posted. For larger and/or more involved
patches and patchsets, the review process may take longer.
