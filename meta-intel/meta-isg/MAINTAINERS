This file contains a list of BSP maintainers for the BSPs contained in
the meta-intel/meta-isg repository.

Please submit any patches against meta-intel/meta-isg BSPs to the
maintainer of the BSP in question and to the meta-intel mailing list
(meta-intel@yoctoproject.org).  Also, if your patches are available
via a public git repository, please also include a URL to the repo and
branch containing your patches as that makes it easier for maintainers
to grab and test your patches.

If you have problems with or questions about a particular BSP, feel
free to contact the maintainer directly (cc:ing the meta-intel mailing
list puts it in the archive and helps other people who might have the
same questions in the future), but please try to do the following
first:

  - look in the Yocto Project Bugzilla
    (http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/) to see if a problem has
    already been reported

  - look through recent entries of the meta-intel
    (https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/meta-intel/) and Yocto
    (https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/) mailing list
    archives to see if other people have run into similar problems or
    had similar questions answered.

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	meta-haswell-wc/    all files in and below meta-haswell-wc
	   F:	meta-haswell-wc/*   all files in meta-haswell-wc, but not below
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.

Please keep this list in alphabetical order.
