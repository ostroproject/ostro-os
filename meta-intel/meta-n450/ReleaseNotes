KNOWN ISSUES
============

See bugzilla.yoctoproject.org

382 - oprofile-server on PPC is built big-endian while oprofile-viewer 
      on host system may built with little-endian, but oprofile-server
      and oprofile-viewer are not implemented to correctly handle
      conversion between host byte order and network byte order, so
      oprofile-server and oprofile-viewer may run into connection issue.

439 - No audio from the Blacksand board Front Channel auido jack.
      Workaround: run the following cmd: 'amixer sset "Front" 30 on'

467 - Issues building with Fedora 14, this distribution provided a version
      of make that is not compatible with the Poky build system, the
      workaround it to build a native version of make via the build system.
      Users of Fedora 14 will need to do a 'bitbake make-native' before
      running any other targets.

429 - Building poky from scratch with /opt/poky in your path cause host
      contamination issues, be sure that /opt/poky is not in your path
      if building from scratch

160 - The Emenlow Hardware gets stuck in the HW Reboot sequence and needs
      to be power cycled.

Zypper / RPM Issues
489/490/491 - Due to some archetectual difference between Zypper and RPM5.0,
      there are some compatibility issues that prevent zypper from
      working correctly. 
      Packages can still be managed with the rpm commands.
