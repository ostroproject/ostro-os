This README file contains information on building the meta-sys940x BSP
layer, and booting the images contained in the /binary directory.
Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

The Inforce SYS940x platform consists of the Intel Atom E6xx
processor, plus the Intel EG20T Platform Controller Hub (Tunnel Creek
+ Topcliff).

It also supports the E6xx embedded on-chip graphics via the Intel
Embedded Media and Graphics Driver (EMGD) 1.10 Driver.

I. Building the meta-sys940x BSP layer
===================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP tarball from the 'Board Support
Package (BSP) Downloads' page of the Yocto Project website.

Having done that, and assuming you extracted the BSP tarball contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build an sys940x image
by adding the location of the meta-sys940x layer to bblayers.conf, along
with the meta-intel layer itself (to access common metadata shared
between BSPs) e.g.:

  yocto/meta-intel \
  yocto/meta-intel/meta-sys940x \

The meta-sys940x layer contains support for two different machine
configurations. These configurations are identical except for the fact
that the one prefixed with 'sys940x' makes use of the Intel-proprietary
EMGD 1.10 graphics driver, while the one prefixed with 'sys940x-noemgd'
does not.

If you want to enable the layer that supports EMGD graphics add the
following to the local.conf file:

  MACHINE ?= "sys940x"

The 'sys940x' machine includes the emgd-driver-bin package, which has a
proprietary license that must be whitelisted by adding the string
"license_emgd-driver-bin_1.10" to the LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST variable
in your local.conf.  For example:

  LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "license_emgd-driver-bin_1.10"

If you want to enable the layer that does not support EMGD graphics
add the following to the local.conf file:

  MACHINE ?= "sys940x-noemgd"

You should then be able to build an sys940x image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-sato

At the end of a successful build, you should have a live image that
you can boot from a USB flash drive (see instructions on how to do
that below, in the section 'Booting the images from /binary').

As an alternative to downloading the BSP tarball, you can also work
directly from the meta-intel git repository.  For each BSP in the
'meta-intel' repository, there are multiple branches, one
corresponding to each major release starting with 'laverne' (0.90), in
addition to the latest code which tracks the current master (note that
not all BSPs are present in every release).  Instead of extracting a
BSP tarball at the top level of your yocto build tree, you can
equivalently check out the appropriate branch from the meta-intel
repository at the same location.


II. Booting the images in /binary
=================================

This BSP contains bootable live images, which can be used to directly
boot Yocto off of a USB flash drive.

Under Linux, insert a USB flash drive.  Assuming the USB flash drive
takes device /dev/sdf, use dd to copy the live image to it.  For
example:

# dd if=core-image-sato-sys940x-20101207053738.hddimg of=/dev/sdf
# sync
# eject /dev/sdf

This should give you a bootable USB flash device.  Insert the device
into a bootable USB socket on the target, and power on.  This should
result in a system booted to the Sato graphical desktop.

If you want a terminal, use the arrows at the top of the UI to move to
different pages of available applications, one of which is named
'Terminal'.  Clicking that should give you a root terminal.

If you want to ssh into the system, you can use the root terminal to
ifconfig the IP address and use that to ssh in.  The root password is
empty, so to log in type 'root' for the user name and hit 'Enter' at
the Password prompt: and you should be in.

----

If you find you're getting corrupt images on the USB (it doesn't show
the syslinux boot: prompt, or the boot: prompt contains strange
characters), try doing this first:

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdf bs=1M count=512
